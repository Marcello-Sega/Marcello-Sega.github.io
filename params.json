{"name":"Marcello Sega's GitHub Pages","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my GitHub Pages.\r\nI am a scientist working at the border between chemistry and physics. My main investigation tool is computer simulations. For this reason I am often developing scientific software, and some of it is now on github. Feel free to download and use my code: just, please, give credit where credit is due! If you are unsure on how to do that, drop me an email.\r\n\r\nMy actual projects hosted on GitHub are:\r\n\r\n* [A Gromacs version with Gaussian charges](http://marcello-sega.github.io/gromacs/)\r\n* [ITIM/GITIM implementation for gromacs](http://marcello-sega.github.io/gitim/)\r\n* [A flexible/efficient code to compute correlation functions](http://marcello-sega.github.io/fftcw/)\r\n\r\nI am also contributing to [ESPResSo](http://espressomd.org/) with [my GitHub fork](https://github.com/Marcello-Sega/espresso)\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for my scientific activity, instead, you'd better look at some of the following pages:\r\n\r\n* http://www.researcherid.com/rid/C-8863-2009\r\n* http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wg8kiOAAAAAJ\r\n* http://www.mdy.univie.ac.at/people/sega/sega.html\r\n\r\nEnjoy!
