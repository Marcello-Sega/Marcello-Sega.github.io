{"name":"Marcello Sega's GitHub Pages","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my GitHub Pages.\r\nI am a scientist working at the border between chemistry and physics. My main investigation tool is computer simulations. For this reason I am often developing scientific software, and some of it is now on github. Feel free to download and use my code: just, please, give credit where credit is due! If you are unsure on how to do that, drop me an email.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for my scientific activity, instead, you'd better look at some of the following pages:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.researcherid.com/rid/C-8863-2009\r\n\r\nhttp://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wg8kiOAAAAAJ\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mdy.univie.ac.at/people/sega/sega.html\r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
